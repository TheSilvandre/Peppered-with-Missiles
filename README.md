# Peppered with Missiles!
This project was developed with the sole goal of learning about the full process of game development. From the conception of an idea to marketing and publishing. Although in the end the game wasn't very popular, it did give me the know-how to start working on my next game!

If you want to try a playable version of the game you can find it on the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sylvangamestudios.PepperedWithMissiles "Download on the Play Store")!
